Use the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) to display their top stories of the day on a web page.

***As a rule of thumb, never include credentials in client side JavaScript.***

An exception to that are for APIs that are:

Free, and
Only allow GET requests, and
Surface public data that’s accessible elsewhere.
For this project, the New York Times API meets those criteria, so the danger in exposing your credentials is low. For real projects with other APIs, you’ll probably need to keep your credentials safe.
