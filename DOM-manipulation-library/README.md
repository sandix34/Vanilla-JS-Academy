Create a DOM manipulation library with public methods you can use toâ€¦

- Get an array of items from the DOM.
- Get the first and last matching items from the DOM.
- Add and remove a class to all matching elements.
  
It should work like jQuery, where you pass in a selector, and can then call helper functions on your matching elements.
