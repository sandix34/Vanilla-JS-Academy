Modify our weather app script to convert it into a plugin.

Modify the script to let developers:

- Pass in their own selector to render the weather into.

- Decide whether to show temperatures in Fahrenheit of Celsius.

- Change what message is shown (ex. `It's currently {temperature} and {conditions} in {location}`).

- Enable or disable the icon for the weather conditions.
